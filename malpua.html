    </h2><hr>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <p>
        1. Prepare the batter:
In a bowl, mix flour, semolina, sugar, fennel, cardamom, and dry fruits.
Slowly add milk to make a smooth, thick pouring batter (like dosa batter).
Let it rest for 30 minutes (optional but helps texture).<br><br>


2. Make sugar syrup:
In a pan, boil sugar and water until slightly sticky (1-string consistency).
Add cardamom and saffron. Turn off the heat.
Add rose water/kewra for aroma (optional).<br><br>


3. Fry Malpua:
Heat ghee in a shallow pan.
Pour a ladle of batter into hot ghee :it will spread into a round shape.
Cook on medium heat until golden and crispy on both sides.
Remove and dip immediately into warm sugar syrup for 1-2 minutes.
Take it out and let excess syrup drain.<br><br>
